  "sr_content": "When a specific version of HTTP allows such whitespace to appear in a message, a field parsing implementation MUST exclude such whitespace prior to evaluating the field value.",
  "sr_context": {
    "Previous Paragraph": "HTTP field values consist of a sequence of characters in a format defined by the field's grammar. Each field's grammar is usually defined using ABNF ([RFC5234]).",
    "Current Paragraph": "A field value does not include leading or trailing whitespace. When a specific version of HTTP allows such whitespace to appear in a message, a field parsing implementation MUST exclude such whitespace prior to evaluating the field value.",
    "Next Paragraph": "Field values are usually constrained to the range of US-ASCII characters [USASCII]. Fields needing a greater range of characters can use an encoding, such as the one defined in [RFC8187]. Historically, HTTP allowed field content with text in the ISO-8859-1 charset [ISO-8859-1], supporting other charsets only through use of [RFC2047] encoding. Specifications for newly defined fields SHOULD limit their values to visible US-ASCII octets (VCHAR), SP, and HTAB. A recipient SHOULD treat other allowed octets in field content (i.e., obs-text) as opaque data."

  "openai_result": {
    "conformance": "PARTIAL",
    "reasoning": "The implementation is clearly intended to deal with parsing cookie header values, and part of that parsing involves ignoring extraneous whitespace. In particular, the code steps through each token and explicitly advances past any leading whitespace (see the loop using apr_isspace). This shows that the author was mindful of the fact that fields in an HTTP message might legally include whitespace that should not interfere with interpretation. However, the specification requires that whitespace be excluded from the field value before evaluation, and the implementation only removes whitespace at the beginning of each token. For example, in a token such as 'name= value', the whitespace immediately following the '=' is not removed (because after comparing the token\u2019s start with the expected name, the code does a pstrdup starting at trim+len without further trimming). Additionally, when rebuilding any cookie values that do not match the target cookie (the new_cookie), the code does not perform any trimming. Thus, while the implementation does address trimming of whitespace (at the start of each token), it does not fully satisfy the requirement to exclude all extraneous whitespace prior to field evaluation. This partial handling may result in leftover whitespace affecting the evaluation of the cookie\u2019s value.",
    "issues": [
      {
        "description": "Only leading whitespace is trimmed. Whitespace immediately after the '=' is not removed, which means that if a cookie field contains whitespace between the cookie name and its value, the value is not properly cleaned before evaluation.",

        "expected_behavior": "The implementation should remove all extraneous whitespace (both before and immediately after the cookie name delimiter) so that the field value is clean before any comparisons or further processing.",
        "actual_behavior": "Only the leading whitespace is removed. Any whitespace after the '=' remains as part of the cookie value.",

      },
      {
        "description": "Non-target cookie tokens are not trimmed. When rebuilding the new_cookie value with apr_pstrcat, the code does not remove any excess whitespace, which might lead to unintended whitespace in the resulting header.",

        "line_numbers": "Approximately lines 20\u201323",

        "severity": "LOW"
      }
    ],
    "conclusion": "While the code is clearly meant to address the requirement by attempting to strip out extraneous whitespace when parsing cookie header values, its approach is only partially conformant. It removes leading whitespace from tokens but does not clean up whitespace immediately following the cookie-name delimiter or in all parts of the cookie value. This partial trimming could lead to issues when a field value includes permitted whitespace that should be excluded prior to evaluation. In summary, the implementation has partial conformance to the protocol requirement."
