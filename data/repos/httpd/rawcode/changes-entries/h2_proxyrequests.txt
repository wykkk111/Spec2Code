  *) mod_http2: new directive `H2ProxyRequests on|off` to enable handling
     of HTTP/2 requests in a forward proxy configuration.
     General forward proxying is enabled via `ProxyRequests`. If the
     HTTP/2 protocol is also enabled for such a server/host, this new
     directive is needed in addition.
