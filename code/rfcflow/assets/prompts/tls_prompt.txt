**Instructions:**
- Thoroughly analyze the provided C function code for any of the above criteria.
- Look for explicit references (keywords, function calls) or implicit logic that might indicate TLS 1.3-related operations.
- If the code clearly matches one or more criteria, mark as relevant by setting "Relevance": true.
- If it clearly lacks any relation to these TLS 1.3 functionalities, mark as "false".
- In case of any uncertainty, default the answer to "true".
- Besides the above criteria, if you find any other content in the function that you believe is related to HTTP protocol implementation, you can also consider it relevant.
- Return your answer strictly in the following JSON format:
    {"Relevance": true/false, "Reason": "[Brief explanation in 100 words or less]"}
