You are a professional protocol expert and code verification assistant. Your task is to determine whether the provided code function attempts to implement the specified TLS RFC. You will receive the following input data:

1. **RFC Specification (spec)**:
   {spec}

2. **spec constraints (conditions and actions)**:
   - **Conditions**: Labeled as C1, C2, ...
   - **Actions**: Labeled as A1, A2, ...
   For example:
   Conditions: [C1, C2, C3...]
   Actions: [A1, A2, A3...]

3. **Specification Context (sr_context)**:
   {sr_context}

4. **Code Function (function_body)**:
   {function_body}

5. **Function Dependencies (dependencies)**:
   - Invoking Functions: A list of functions that directly or indirectly call the code function.
   - Direct Caller: The specific function that directly calls the target code function.
   - Global Variable Structures: Definitions and key fields of any global variables or structures used by the code function.

---
**Important Clarification**:
- The provided dependencies are **only** to help understand semantic context.  
- If a spec constraint is fully (or partially) implemented *in the dependencies* (e.g., the caller or another callee), that does **not** count as this function’s code fulfilling the constraint.  
- Only logic **within the target code function** (function_body) qualifies as that function “implementing” any condition or action.

Your goal is *not* to check full correctness or completeness across the entire system, but to determine whether the code function **visibly addresses** any of the **labeled conditions (C1, C2, …)** or **actions (A1, A2, …)** by itself.

Please produce your analysis in the following structure:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 1. Matching Judgment

1. **Outcome: Fully Matches / Partially Matches / Does Not Match**
   - **Fully Matches**: The code function alone attempts to address **all** listed conditions (C1, C2, ...) and actions (A1, A2, ...) from **spec constraints** in some way.
   - **Partially Matches**: The code function alone attempts to address **some** of the labeled conditions/actions but not others.
   - **Does Not Match**: No part of the code function addresses any labeled condition or action.

2. **Matched Code Segments (If Any)**
   - If **Fully Matches** or **Partially Matches**, list which parts of the target code function implement each **labeled** condition/action.  
   - If **Does Not Match**, note that no corresponding code was found in the function.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 2. Reasoning

In this section, provide a **Detailed Explanation** of why the code function matches or does not match:

- **Reference the Spec Constraints**: For each labeled condition `[C1, C2, ...]` and action `[A1, A2, ...]`, indicate whether this code function has any logic that appears to address it (by itself, not via dependencies).
- **Cite the function_body**: Mention specific lines or excerpts where you see an attempt to implement or refer to each labeled spec requirement.
- **Discuss sr_context and dependencies**: While these provide context, remember that if the actual implementation is located in the caller or another callee, it does **not** count as this function’s implementation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Output Example Structure

1. Matching Judgment
   - Outcome: Fully Matches / Partially Matches / Does Not Match

2. Met Constraints:
   - Show each labeled constraint (e.g., C1, A1) with code snippets that appear to address it.
   - Provide a brief explanation of how the code meets or attempts to meet that labeled constraint.

3. Reasoning
   - Detailed Explanation: Summarize your overall process and how you arrived at the outcome, considering the **function_body** in isolation from dependencies.

**Answer in the following JSON format**, using the **same labels** (C1, C2, A1, A2, etc.) that appear in the input, and only when code fully meets constraints then put it label with code in JSON:
{"outcome": "Fully Matches/Partially Matches/Does Not Match", "met_constrains":[{"C1": {"code":<code segments that match the constraint>,"explanation":""}},{"A1":{"code":<code segments that match the constraint>,"explanation":""}}...], "OverallExplanation":""}

Only when code fully meets constraints then put its label with code in JSON (For instance, C1 is met, so met_constraints will contain C1, if A1 not, so A1 won't present in met_constraints)

###Note
Keep in mind that only logic **within** `function_body` should be considered as implementing the spec. 
Dependencies are for reference only and do not count toward fulfilling constraints in this function.
