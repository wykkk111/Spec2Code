Review the provided code snippet and determine which HTTP-related subcategories the code implements or handles. Focus on the actual behaviors of the code to identify all applicable subcategories.

### Context

We have a seven-level top-level categorization for HTTP-related functionalities (A, B, C, D, E, F, G). Each top-level category is further divided into three (or more) subcategories (e.g., A1, A2, A3) for more specific groupings. Given a piece of code, you need to check if it *implements* or *handles*  any of these categories and subcategories.

**Top-Level Categories and Their Subcategories**

A. HTTP Message Syntax and Parsing
 A1. Grammar and Compliance
  Description: Ensures that HTTP messages strictly follow ABNF grammar rules and that elements specific to each role are generated correctly.
 A2. Robustness and Error Handling
  Description: Provides mechanisms to tolerate and recover from malformed or non-conforming message elements, ensuring stable and secure parsing.
 A3. Start Line Format and Size
  Description: Handles the parsing of request/response start lines, enforcing correct formatting, length limitations, and proper management of extraneous whitespace.
 A4. Protocol Version Negotiation
  Description: Manages the negotiation and selection of HTTP protocol versions, ensuring responses adhere to a version supported by both client and server.
 A5. Message Body Framing and Transfer Encoding
  Description: Deals with the framing of the message body, including content-length, chunked transfer encoding, and ensuring message integrity during transport.

B. URI and Resource Identification
 B1. Authority and Host
  Description: Validates and parses the host and port components in URIs, ensuring no empty host identifiers and proper handling of default ports.
 B2. URI Normalization
  Description: Processes URIs into a canonical form to ensure that equivalent URIs are consistently recognized as referencing the same resource.
 B3. Userinfo Handling
  Description: Manages user information embedded in URIs, mitigating risks such as phishing and the inadvertent disclosure of sensitive details.
 B4. Scheme and Secure Transport
  Description: Ensures that the appropriate scheme (HTTP vs. HTTPS) is enforced and that secure transport conditions (like valid TLS certificates) are met.

C. Header Field Structure and Processing
 C1. Field Combination and Duplication
  Description: Regulates how duplicate header fields are merged or rejected to maintain the intended semantics of the headers.
 C2. List Syntax in Header Values
  Description: Handles the parsing of comma-separated header values and the treatment of empty list elements to preserve proper structure.
 C3. Whitespace and Line Folding
  Description: Manages the removal and normalization of extraneous whitespace and obsolete line folding in header fields to ensure clean data.
 C4. Quoted Strings and Comments
  Description: Processes quoted strings and comments within headers, including escape sequences and proper interpretation of quoted content.
 C5. Date and Time Formats
  Description: Ensures accurate parsing and formatting of date/time header fields by supporting multiple HTTP date formats and performing necessary conversions.
 C6. Field Names and Connection-Specific Fields
  Description: Validates header field names and distinguishes connection-specific (hop-by-hop) headers from end-to-end headers for proper processing.

D. Connection Management and Protocol Control
 D1. Persistent Connections and Pipelining
  Description: Manages keep-alive and pipelined request processing to maximize connection reuse and improve efficiency.
 D2. Early Responses and Timeouts
  Description: Defines how early responses and request timeouts are handled to avoid misuse and to decide when to terminate or continue processing a request.
 D3. Connection Closure Handshake
  Description: Specifies the proper handshake procedures for gracefully closing connections, ensuring that both parties acknowledge the termination.
 D4. TLS and Secure Transport
  Description: Covers TLS-specific requirements, including secure data transport and the proper exchange of closure alerts during connection termination.
 D5. Protocol Upgrade and Negotiation
  Description: Handles mechanisms for upgrading HTTP protocols or negotiating alternative protocols based on client and server capabilities.

E. HTTP Semantics and Content Handling
 E1. Methods and Safe Usage
  Description: Defines constraints and safe usage patterns for HTTP methods to prevent unintended side effects and ensure safe operations.
 E2. Protocol Identification Fields
  Description: Manages the generation and validation of identification headers (e.g., User-Agent, Server) to provide clear and concise protocol information.
 E3. Content Negotiation
  Description: Implements the logic for content negotiation, allowing clients to specify preferences that influence the server’s response representation.
 E4. Request Context
  Description: Ensures that additional contextual information used during request processing does not alter the core semantics of the request.
 E5. Authentication
  Description: Specifies the rules for handling authentication headers and challenge parameters, ensuring compliance with prescribed syntax and security requirements.

F. Caching, Conditional Requests, and Partial Responses
 F1. Caching and Intermediary Use
  Description: Outlines rules for cache usage and the role of intermediaries, ensuring transparent caching behavior and adherence to cache policies.
 F2. Conditional Request Handling
  Description: Details the evaluation order and processing rules for conditional request headers (e.g., If-Modified-Since, If-None-Match) to determine response eligibility.
 F3. Partial Content (Range Requests)
  Description: Specifies how to handle range requests by generating appropriate partial content responses while enforcing compliance constraints.
 F4. Response Content Guidelines
  Description: Provides guidelines for generating response content (e.g., in multi-choice or conflict scenarios) that is informative and useful to clients.

G. Proxy/Intermediary and Privacy Considerations
 G1. Forwarding Headers and Host Privacy
  Description: Manages the combination and forwarding of headers (e.g., Via, Forwarded) to ensure sensitive host information is anonymized.
 G2. User Privacy and Identity
  Description: Ensures that connection-level details do not inadvertently expose user identities or sensitive data, thereby protecting user privacy.


### Instructions

1. **Analyze the Code:**
   - Read through the code snippet carefully, noting any behaviors that are related to HTTP message generation or interpretation.

2. **Assign Categories:**
   - Determine which top-level categories ([A, B, C, D, E, F, G]) and subcategories (e.g., A1, A2, A3) are relevant based on the code’s behaviors.
   - Use the criteria defined for each subcategory to guide your decision-making.

3. **Multiple Subcategories:**
   - Record all subcategories that apply to the code. Code may fall under several categories and subcategories simultaneously.

4. **No Match:**
   - If the code does not match any subcategory, explicitly matched state "No"


### Notes
- Focus on the implementation and handling aspects of the code.
- Review each top-level category and its subcategories carefully for a comprehensive analysis.
- The matched results should only include the subcategories like(A1, B2, C3)instead of the top-level categories.

###Output Format
Return the matched subcategories in the following JSON format:

{
  "matched_subcategories": ["A1", "A3", "C2", "D1"]
}

If no subcategories apply to the given code, return:

{
  "matched_subcategories": []
}
