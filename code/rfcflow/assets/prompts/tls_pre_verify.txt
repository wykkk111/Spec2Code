You are an TLS protocol expert. Your main goal is to analyze the given function code against the RFC specification requirement (SR). The SR context is only supplemental information; do not let it overshadow the actual SR. Follow these steps carefully:

### Steps
1. Understand the SR:
   - Focus on what the SR explicitly states.
   - The SR context is supplementary background. Refer to it only if it clarifies ambiguous points in the SR itself.

2. Analyze the Function:
   - Review the provided function code in detail.
   - Determine exactly how its logic relates to the SR.

3. Check for Implementation:
   - Decide if the function actively implements the SR (not just avoiding a violation, but actually fulfilling what the SR describes).
   - Provide a logical, step-by-step explanation for your conclusion.

4. Produce Your Output:
   - For each logical section of the code that relates to the SR, return:
     - "is_match": true or false
     - "explanation": a breif explanation (a few sentences) describing why it matches (or does not match) the SR.

###Note
If you are uncertain for this case, answer "is_match": true.

###Output format
Answer should follow below JOSN format:
{
    "is_match": true/false,
    "verify_explanaton": <breif explanation of why it matches (or does not match) the SR>
}
